Lab 8-1 A Generic Register 

Objective: Use nonblocking assignments while describing a register. 

The VeriRISC CPU contains an accumulator register and an instruction register. One generic register definition can serve both purposes. On the active-high clock edge the register value becomes zero if the ‚Äúrst‚Äù input is true and
otherwise becomes the data input value if the 'load'ù input is true. 

Further Information 

Statements in different processes that are scheduled to execute in the same simulation cycle can execute in any order. Thus, any variable that processes use to communicate between themselves, that is, one process writes and one or more processes read, must be written using update semantics such that the variable
does not assume the written value until all reading processes have read the variable. Up to this point, almost all the procedural assignments you have seen are blocking assignments (=), that is, the assignment statement blocks until the assignment completes, which is immediately unless you delay it. To support update semantics, Verilog also provides a nonblocking assignment (<=), that is,an assignment statement that is scheduled to occur and does not block further execution while waiting for the assignment to complete. A generally good
heuristic is to use the nonblocking version for any assignment to a variable that represents design storage (such as a register).

1. Change to the lab8-reg directory and examine the files provided therein: 

README.txt       Lab instructions
register_test.v  Register test

2. Create the register.v file, and using your favorite editor, describe therein the register module. Parameterize the register data input and output width so that the instantiating module can specify the width of each instance. Assign a default value to the parameter.

3. Using the provided test module, test your register description, enter: 

irun register.v register_test.v 

You should see the below results:
At time 20 rst=0 load=1 data_in=01010101 data_out=01010101
At time 30 rst=0 load=1 data_in=10101010 data_out=10101010
At time 40 rst=0 load=1 data_in=11111111 data_out=11111111
At time 50 rst=1 load=1 data_in=11111111 data_out=00000000
TEST PASSED


4. Correct your register description as needed.
