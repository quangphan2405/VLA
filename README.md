# Self-learning repo for creating a RISC-type CPU Model

The CPU consists of ALU, Accumulator, Control, Memory and Program counter. They are created and tested individually and then combined as a complete CPU model.

I also learn to use Verilog subroutines, to implement FSM and Serial Interface Receiver.
